AJAX Chat

About
-----

A simple web chat application. Users open a webpage in which they enter their messages. Their messages are then displayed in real-time on the webpage for other users to see.

Technical Information
---------------------

This application is programmed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX and PHP. Messages are saved in ajax_chat_message_log.txt in order to retrieve and display old conversations from previous sessions in newer ones at startup.

Installation
------------

Move all files to a web server, preferably in a single directory.

How to Use
----------

Point your browser to ajax_chat.html. Enter the username you would like to use in the current session. Start writing messages!

Notes
-----

To clear the message log, simply empty ajax_chat_message_log.txt

Background and History
----------------------

This project started off as a way to practice JavaScript and the concept of AJAX. I have no serious intentions for this aside from mere practice.
